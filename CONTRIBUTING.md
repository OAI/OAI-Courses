# Contributing Guide

This is a guide to contributing to course content. Contributing in this context means:

- Reviewing or improving existing course content.
- Creating new courses or new course modules.

Please see the sections below for the details.

## Existing Content

Keen to review a course or have feedback after taking the course?

Think something could be improved?

You've got three options.

### Bug Fix

- Something is clearly wrong and you can point to the issue on a given line in the content.
- Raise an [Issue](https://github.com/OAI/OAI-Courses/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) using the right template and do the business.
- Optionally, join the [OpenAPI Slack](https://open-api.slack.com) and drop a note onto the [#oai-courses](https://open-api.slack.com/archives/C06E9B1S879) if you think the bug warrants any ad-hoc discussion across a wider group.

### Formal Review

- Fork the repository to your organization in GitHub.
- Perform your review:
  - For Markdown changes simply change the file and do whatever you do for checking a pushing back to your fork.
  - For any other assets - images, etc. - just go ahead and commit the new asset.
- Create a pull request based on the review pull request template.
- Add [sensiblewood](https://github.com/SensibleWood) as a reviewer.
- Join the [OpenAPI Slack](https://open-api.slack.com) and drop a note onto the [#oai-courses](https://open-api.slack.com/archives/C06E9B1S879) with a link to your pull request.
- We will then discuss comments both in the pull request and on Slack as required. There may be some back-and-forth based on what the comments are.
- Your changes are merged, and you join the merry throng of contributors to this repository.

### Informal Review

- Start a [Discussion](https://github.com/OAI/OAI-Courses/discussions/new/choose) on this repository.
- Drop in your ideas.
- We'll discuss and then make changes using normal GitHub Issues as required.

## New Content

Ideas for a new course or a course module?

Please do as follows:

- Either start a [Discussion](https://github.com/OAI/OAI-Courses/discussions/new?category=ideas) or raise an [Issue](https://github.com/OAI/OAI-Courses/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) :point_left: choose the means that suits you and the new content idea best.
- Join the [OpenAPI Slack](https://open-api.slack.com) and drop a note onto the [#oai-courses](https://open-api.slack.com/archives/C06E9B1S879) with a link to your issue.
- From that point onwards it's all kind of ad-hoc for now - we'll work out a good way of working together.
