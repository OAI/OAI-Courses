# Contributing Guide

This is a guide to contributing to course content. Contributing in this context means:

- Reviewing or improving existing course content.
- Creating new courses or new course modules.

Please see the sections below for the details.

## Existing Stuff

Keen to review a course or have feedback after taken the course?

Think something could be improved?

Please do as follows:

- Fork the repository to your organisation in GitHub.
- Perform your review:
  - For Markdown changes simply change the file and do whatever you do for checking a pushing back to your fork.
  - For PowerPoint make your changes and **add a Comment in the file indicating the reason for the change**.
  - For any other assets - images, etc. - just go ahead and commit the new asset.
- Create a pull request based on the review pull request template.
- Add [sensiblewood](https://github.com/SensibleWood) as a reviewer.
- Join the [OpenAPI Slack](https://open-api.slack.com) and drop a note onto the [#oai-courses](https://open-api.slack.com/archives/C06E9B1S879) with a link to your pull request.
- We will then discuss comments both in the pull request and on Slack as required. There may be some back-and-forth based on what the comments are.
- Your changes are merged, and you join the merry throng of contributors to this repository.

## New Stuff

Ideas for a new course or a course module?

Please do as follows:

- Raise an issue on this [repo](https://github.com/OAI/OAI-Courses/issues) (template to come).
- Join the [OpenAPI Slack](https://open-api.slack.com) and drop a note onto the [#oai-courses](https://open-api.slack.com/archives/C06E9B1S879) with a link to your issue.
- From that point onwards it's all kind of ad-hoc for now - we'll work out a good way of working together.
